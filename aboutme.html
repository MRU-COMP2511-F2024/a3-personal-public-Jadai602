            <h2>Hello, I'm Jaden!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website! I'm currently in my second year of the <strong>BCIS (Bachelor of Computer Information Systems)</strong> program. My journey in technology has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited to continue developing my skills in areas like programming, system design, and, of course, web development.</p>
            
            <p>One of my passions outside of academics is <strong>Muay Thai</strong>. This martial art has taught me discipline, resilience, and focus, qualities that I carry into my studies and other aspects of life. Whether it's practicing techniques in the gym or studying its rich history, Muay Thai holds a special place in my life.</p>
            
            <p>As part of this web design course, I've had the opportunity to learn and apply HTML and CSS in creating functional and visually appealing websites. This website reflects my progress and growth in web development. I've enjoyed the process of learning to structure content, design layouts, and enhance usability, and I'm eager to further expand my skills in this field.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for visiting my site. Feel free to explore and learn more about my interests and work!</p>
