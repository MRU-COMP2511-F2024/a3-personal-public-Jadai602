        <h2>History of Muay Thai</h2>
        <section class="history">
            <p>Muay Thai, also known as the "Art of Eight Limbs," has a long and storied history that dates back centuries to its origins in Thailand. It evolved from the military training techniques of the Siamese army, originally referred to as "Muay Boran" or "ancient boxing." The practice of using fists, elbows, knees, and shins as striking tools in combat has made Muay Thai distinct from other martial arts that focus primarily on hand techniques.</p>
            <p>The roots of Muay Thai can be traced back to the early 16th century, when the Thai army adopted the fighting style as a means of defense against invaders. The practice was integral to military training, and soldiers trained rigorously to develop strength, discipline, and combat skills that would serve them both on and off the battlefield. Over time, the martial art grew in popularity as a sport and cultural tradition.</p>

            <p>During the reign of King Rama V in the late 19th century, Muay Thai began to transition into its modern form. Boxing rings were introduced, and the use of hand wraps evolved into modern-day gloves. The creation of formal rules helped standardize the sport and contributed to its spread beyond Thailand's borders. Today, Muay Thai is practiced worldwide, both as a competitive sport and as a form of physical conditioning. It is renowned for its effectiveness in mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions, where fighters use Muay Thai techniques in their training for striking and clinching.</p>
