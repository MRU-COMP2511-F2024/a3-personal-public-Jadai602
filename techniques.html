                <h3>Technique 1: The Roundhouse Kick</h3>
                <p>The Muay Thai roundhouse kick utilizes a full-body rotational motion and has gained popularity among practitioners of various combat sports. This kick is executed from a circular stance, with the back leg positioned slightly behind the front leg, typically shoulder-width apart. This contrasts with traditional upper body fighting styles like boxing, which require a broader stance for stability. The power of the roundhouse kick primarily comes from the rotational movement of the hips, while the counter-rotation of the shoulders and arms can also contribute additional torque, enhancing the force behind the kick.</p>

                <h3>Technique 2: The Elbow Strike</h3>
                <p>The elbow can serve as a versatile striking weapon in various ways: horizontally, diagonally upward, diagonally downward, as an uppercut, downward, backward-spinning, and even in flying attacks. When delivered from the side, it can function either as a finishing move or as a method to cut the opponent's eyebrow, potentially impairing their vision with blood. Among these techniques, diagonal elbows are faster compared to other types, though they may lack the same power.</p>

                <h3>Technique 3: The Knee Strike</h3>
                <p>The straight knee, often referred to as the front knee, is a fundamental knee strike that involves thrusting the front of the knee into the head or body of an opponent. This technique can be executed from a standing position, whether the fighters are at a distance or engaged in a clinch. A particularly effective scenario for delivering a front knee is within the double collar tie, where the opponent's head is controlled. Common targets for the front knee include the head, hips, ribs, solar plexus, stomach, and thighs. Traditionally in Muay Thai, a double collar tie followed by a front knee to the face is known as Hak Kor Aiyara.</p>
